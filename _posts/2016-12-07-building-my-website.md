#### I started to use github page and jekyll to make my personal website/blog a couple of weeks ago, and here is the result! I am going to flesh out the projects section of my website, and I will aim to regularly post techniquely themed blog posts like this one. Basically it will be a way for me to write down and share what I learn during my studies in computer science, machine learning and genomics.

#### **What is [Github Page](https://pages.github.com)**

#### Github gives each user a free domain at username.github.io. To start using that domain you just need to make a new repo named "your_github_handle.github.io" and then put an index.html in the repo, and them bam a couple of minutes later your website is available at that domain. Example: This website [*mollyzhang.github.io*](https://mollyzhang.github.io)'s source code is at [github.com/mollyzhang/mollyzhang.github.io](https://github.com/MollyZhang/MollyZhang.github.io).

#### Github page generate the static files of your website with this tool "Jekyll"


#### **What's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)**

#### "Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby", in other words, jekyll generates .html, .css etc files for your website and then the website is served staticly. Unlike Flask or Django, there is no database behind Jekyll, therefore Jekyll is very light weight and fast. You shouldn't try to  make a complicated web application with Jekyll but it surely makes it easy to make simple websites/blogs.

#### Jekyll's website has some amazing video tutorials (each 10 to 20 minutes) on how to use it at [jekyll.tips](http://jekyll.tips)
